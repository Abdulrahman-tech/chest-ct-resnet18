# chest-ct-resnet18
In this project, a deep learning network (ResNet18) is constructed and refined to categorize chest CT scan images into several cancer-related classifications. A labeled dataset of CT scans is used to train a ResNet18 model using transfer learning, and its performance is assessed on both training and test sets.
