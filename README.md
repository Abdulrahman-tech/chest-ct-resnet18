# ü´Å Chest CT Scan Classification using ResNet18

In this project, a deep learning network (ResNet18) is constructed and refined to categorize chest CT scan images into several cancer-related classifications. A labeled dataset of CT scans is used to train a ResNet18 model using transfer learning, and its performance is assessed on both training and test sets.

## üìÇ Dataset

The dataset is structured into three folders:
- `train/`
- `valid/`
- `test/`

There are subdirectories inside each folder that are named after the corresponding classes. expert radiologists have classified the pictures, which are CT scans of the lungs.

> **Source**: The dataset was retrieved from Kaggle, originally used for lung cancer detection research and classification challenges.

## üè∑Ô∏è Class Definitions

1. ### **Adenocarcinoma Left Lower Lobe**
   - **Type**: Malignant (Cancer)
   - **Details**: A common form of **non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)** that originates in mucus-secreting glands.
   - **Location**: Left lower lobe of the lung.
   - **Note**: More common in non-smokers and women.

2. ### **Large Cell Carcinoma Left Hilum**
   - **Type**: Malignant (Cancer)
   - **Details**: A fast-growing NSCLC subtype with large, abnormal cells.
   - **Location**: Near the left **hilum** (central part of the lung where vessels and bronchi enter).
   - **Note**: Known for aggressive behavior and rapid spread.

3. ### **Squamous Cell Carcinoma Left Hilum**
   - **Type**: Malignant (Cancer)
   - **Details**: Arises from the squamous cells lining the bronchi.
   - **Location**: Also in the left **hilum**.
   - **Note**: Strongly linked to smoking history.

4. ### **Benign**
   - **Type**: Non-cancerous
   - **Details**: Includes non-malignant abnormalities, such as scars, infections, or nodules.
   - **Note**: No metastatic potential, but some benign lesions require monitoring or treatment.

## üß† Model Architecture

- **Base Model**: [`ResNet18`](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/models/generated/torchvision.models.resnet18.html) pre-trained on ImageNet.
- **Modifications**:
  - Replaced the final fully connected layer with a custom classifier.
  - All layers unfrozen for **full fine-tuning**.
  - Data augmentations applied using `torchvision.transforms`.

## üèÅ Final Results

| Metric        | Value      |
|---------------|------------|
| Train Accuracy| **99.53%** |
| Test Accuracy | **89.14%** |
| Train Loss    | 0.0231     |
| Test Loss     | 0.3442     |

‚úÖ Indicates strong generalization with some room for further validation improvements.
